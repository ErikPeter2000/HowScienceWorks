# How Science Works

This is my homework for the How Science Works practical as part of the OCR A-level Physics course. Here, I investigate which boolean satisfaction problems are the hardest to solve. The intended audience is my physics teacher.

[Here is the report](LaTeX/HowScienceWorks.pdf).

## Project Structure

- `LaTeX/`: Contains the LaTeX source code for the report.
- `PythonCode/`: Contains the Python Jupyter notebook used to process the data, and some old algorithms I wrote to solve the problems.
- `RustCode/`: Contains the Rust source code for the DPLL and WalkSAT algorithms used to solve the problems.
